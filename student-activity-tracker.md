## Storing Time Spent on Assignments/Exams
### User Story: I am a student, and I would like to know how much time I spend on each assignment, project, quiz/test, etc.

1. I would like to add all my classes to a semester and store all my assignments/examinations.
2. I would then like to store the average time spent on these assignments once they were created.
3. I would also like to know the time spent in each class overall.

*The point of this section is to have a ==general overview of the time== everything takes to see if I need to spend more time on certain assignments rather than others and then possibly use this data to prioritize other assignments to help ==maximize one's potential as a student==.*

---

## Expected Time for Assignments
### User Story: I am a student and expect specific projects to take x amount of time.

1. Using the previous section, I would like to store the expected time that it will take to study for tests and complete homework assignments.
2. I would like to create visuals to see the differences between the time I expected and the actual time it took.

*The point of this section is twofold. First, I want to use this data to ==correct my expectations== of a specific class and assignments. Secondly, I want to improve at ==managing my time more accurately==.*

## Assignment Recommendations
### User Story: I am a student and would like to get objective recommendations on what I should do (Priority Levels Using Syllabus).

1. I would like to take into account all the variables relating to the importance of an assignment: proximity to deadline and expected time, expected grade (for the specific class), percentage of the grade (in the syllabus), and some personal importance to specific classes (student's major classes).

*This section aims to get ==accurate recommendations== for specific assignments to avoid bias and to complete higher-priority assignments first.*

---

## Expected Grades
### User Story: I am a student who wants to track expected grades (Factor in GPA).

1. Using the syllabus for each class, I would like to track expected grades to factor into an overall GPA to track my progress when courses don't post grades regularly.

*The point of this section is to allow students to ==track progress== in classes so that I stay caught up and give higher priority to other classes that are lowering my GPA the most.*

---

## Grading Feedback
### User Story: I am a student and would like to track and store feedback from professors from specific classes.

1. I would like to track all the feedback I've received from teachers in subjects I am taking, as these things can easily be forgotten over time once classes end.

*The point of this section gives me a resource to ==look back at past feedback== when trying to complete assignments or take exams.*

---

## User Connection
### User Story: I am a student and would like to be able to track my peer's information for their classes to see how I could improve.

1. I want to create a user system (Using school emails) to add friends and see their profiles and data.
2. I want users to be able to control privacy to prevent just anyone from looking at their information and control their friends to see certain things as well.

*After deliberation with other students, this is probably the biggest difference between this project and other projects with similar functionalities and can ==motivate students in a competitive, collaborative way==.*
